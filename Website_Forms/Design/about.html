      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Hi everyone, I’m Shanna-kay. As someone riddled with anxiety and a
        chronic overthinker, candles have always provided me with the reprieve I
        seek. When I am overwhelmed with my thoughts and life, I create a safe
        space to filter out the unnecessary clutter in my mind and let myself
        breathe. Unbridled Luxe was birthed from the desire to have vegan,
        eco-friendly and non-toxic candles with a soothing crackling wick that
        relaxes you. Also, to make you escape to a place where you can unburden
        yourself with ease and without worries.
      </h3>

      <h3>
        It was inspired by my quirky, flirty and playful personality, meant to
        emphasize the importance of being unapologetic. I have embraced the fact
        that I’ll never be everyone’s cup of tea and that is perfectly fine. And
        my hope is the same for everyone else as well.
      </h3>
